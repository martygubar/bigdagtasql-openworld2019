# Lab 200: Gather Station Details

  ![](images/200/Title-200.png)
  

## Introduction

In Lab 200, you will create an oracle table out of a file stored in hdfs. This file contains station details data in JSON format. You will use Oracle JSON dot notation to parse the fields and create a station details table.

## Lab 200 Objectives

- Connect to HUE and check the data file stored in the HDFS filesystem
- Create a table called "bikes.station_ext" out of this file
- Create a table called "bikes.stations" out of "bikes.stations_ext" using JSON dot notation

## Steps

### **STEP 1:** Check the data files in hdfs

 * From your browser, connect to HUE : http://localhost:8888 and login using `oracle / welcome1`

* Browse the content of the file "station_information.json"

* Notice that the file format is JSON

### **STEP 2:** Create an oracle table called "bikes.station_ext" 

* run the following statement from sql developper 

notice the "TYPE ORACLE_HDFS" statement indicating that the file is on the HDFS filesystem, and LOCATION indicating the directory where the file resides

### **STEP 3:** Show the JSON parsing capabilities of the oracle database using the JSON dot notation

* run the following statement from sql developper

scroll right on the query result tab, and notice how one can access JSON nested fields with the "." notation, and access to arrays with the "[]" notation

###Â **STEP 4:** Create an oracle table called "bikes.station" using JSON dot notation 

* run the following statement from sql developper
